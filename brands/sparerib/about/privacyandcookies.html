<h2>Surveys</h2>

<p>Periodically we will add a popup survey to the Journal Archives &#45; Spare Rib homepage to gather feedback from users. 
<br />This survey is not active for the majority of the year but is usually in effect for the month of November. 
<br />The name for the cookie generated by this survey is generated on the fly but always starts with the letters JJA.</p>
