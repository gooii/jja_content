<h2 id="about">About the project&#58;</h2>

<p>The project is made up of two web resources, the British Library&#39;s curated Spare Rib website and the full run of searchable Spare Rib magazine content available for free via the Journal Archives platform <a href="https://journalarchives.jisc.ac.uk/britishlibrary/sparerib">here.</a></p>

<p>The British Library&#39;s curated Spare Rib website features over 20 contextual articles and 300 examples of content selected from the magazine for anyone interested in discovering more about the history of this iconic magazine. 
Special thanks to our Advisory Board, Marsha Rowe, Sue O&#39;Sullivan, Rose Ades and Ruthie Petrie and to volunteer and part&#45;time project worker Louise Kimpton&#45;Nye.</p>

<h2 id="researchers">Important information for researchers&#58;</h2>

<p>Some material from the <a href="https://journalarchives.jisc.ac.uk/britishlibrary/sparerib">Spare Rib Journal Archives platform</a> has been redacted until the Library is able to secure further copyright permissions.</p>

<p>The material relates to the contributions of approximately 1000 people to the magazine, and makes up around 20&#37; of the content. </p>

<p>The entire run of physical copies of Spare Rib can be consulted in the British Library Reading Rooms and other libraries around the UK.</p>

<p>Spare Rib remains a very rich digital resource, and <a href="http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/socialscience/2016/04/update-on-the-digital-spare-rib-important-information-for-researchers-and-contributors.html">we will reinstate works where permission is granted in future.</a></p> 

<b>If you are a Spare Rib contributor please read below.</b>

<p>If any Spare Rib contributor or a third party objects to the inclusion of their work now or at any point in the future, or wishes to make their content live but with restrictions, we can anonymise, make alterations or remove the material. In this event, please contact&#58; <a href="mailto:noticeandtakedown@bl.uk">noticeandtakedown&#64;bl.co.uk.</a></p>
