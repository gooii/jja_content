<p>This page is intended to assist researchers using Spare Rib <i>specifically</i> on the Journal Archives platform. It is possible to search all of Journal Archives &#40;including Spare Rib&#41; via the normal landing page <a href="/">here</a>, but also to search on Spare Rib only via it&#39;s own landing page, <a href="/britishlibrary/sparerib/">here</a>. This Help page contains information about the Spare Rib&#45;specific parts of the service. 
<!-- <br />
For help with the main Journal Archives service, please see the main Support page <a href="/support">here</a> and the main Help page <a href="/help">here</a>.</p> -->
			
		  <h1 id="navbar">Navigation bar</h1>
            <p>There is a black horizontal navigation bar at the top of the screen on every page of Journal Archives, so you can quickly navigate to any part of the website from any page you are on. Some options are only available on certain pages &#45; for example the Download and Share buttons are only enabled when you have opened an article or issue.
			<br />If you are using the Spare Rib landing page, the Home, About and Support links from the Navigation bar will direct you to Spare Rib&#45;specific versions of those pages. 
			<br />If you wish to access the main Journal Archives site, you can click the link marked &ldquo;Search the whole of Journal Archives&rdquo; from the Spare Rib landing page, or click <a href="/default/home">here</a>.

		  <p>The complete run of the Feminist journal &ldquo;Spare Rib&rdquo; was added to the Journal Archives service in May 2015.
Spare Rib is open to all &#45; no subscription is required to access the Spare Rib content.
<br />
Spare Rib has it&#39;s own separate homepage within Journal Archives found at <a href="/britishlibrary/sparerib">https://journalarchives.jisc.ac.uk/britishlibrary/sparerib</a>  to accomodate extra functionality for this collection.</p>
	
<p>From the Spare Rib homepage, searches only explore the Spare Rib archive &#40;as directed on the page&#41;. You can scroll down the page to see the issue covers, and click them to open a whole issue in the Viewer. 
<br />
Please note that whole issues <strong>do not have the full text available</strong> in the Details panel when viewed this way, although the full text is present for their individual articles. Whole issues can also be downloaded as a single PDF file if desired.
<br />Whilst the full text is not available in the Details panel for full issues, the PDF files for both the full issues and articles can be searched using an external PDF reader such as Adobe Reader if required.</p>	
		
			
            <h1 id="login">Logging in to Journal Archives</h1>
			
			<p>To accommodate the addition of the Spare Rib journal in 2015, the Search feature of the Journal Archives service has been made open to all. 
            <br />As such, it&#39;s possible for anybody to search the complete catalogue, although only the Spare Rib content is open&#45;access for viewing and downloading.
            <br />Without authentication, it isn&#39;t possible to open results in the Viewer or download them as PDFs if they aren&#39;t part of the Spare Rib archive.
			<br />Readers searching on the Spare Rib section of Journal Archives will not encounter any results that require authentication in order to be accessed.
            <br />To access the rest of the content on the main Journal Archives service, a valid authentication is required. You can read more about this <a href="/help/#login">here.</a></p>	
            
       	  <h1 id="search">Searching</h1>
            <h2>Standard search</h2>
            
            <p>We are using <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org">Elasticsearch</a> open source software to index the data in Journal Archives.</p>
            <p>To run a standard search enter your search terms in the search box and select the &quot;search&quot; button. By default, this will search all of the information in the bibliographic records as well as the full text. The number of matching results will be shown to the right of the search box. </p>
            <p>If you do want to limit your search to a particular field, for example Article Title or Author, you can do so using the drop&#45;down list to the left of the search box.</p>
            <p>The options available are&#58;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>All</li>
              <li>Article Title</li>
       <!--   <li>Journal Title</li>
              <li>ISSN/eISSN</li> -->
              <li>Author            </li>
            </ul>

			</span>  
            
          <h2>Advanced Search</h2>
            <p>Simply select  &quot;more search options&quot; on the search page to show additional search features. </p>
            <p>From here you can specify date range, volume, issue, and start page. You can also add new rows and specify whether your terms MUST, SHOULD or MUST NOT appear in your results.</p>
            <p>The first clause of the search &#40;in the main search box&#41; is a MUST &#45; so the results must include whatever goes in that first box. This means that whatever else goes in the search you are essentially starting from a situation where the search in the first box is compulsory. This means that adding a SHOULD clause to this cannot increase the set of results. Adding a SHOULD clause cannot reduce the set of results either &#40;as the clause is optional&#41;.</p>
			<p>This means that adding a SHOULD clause does not change the total number of results. What it does do is re&#45;order the results when using the relevance ranking, so those items matching the SHOULD clauses come to the top.</p>

            <h1 id="operators">Operators, regular expressions and reserved characters </h1>
            <h2>Boolean operators</h2>
            <p>The familiar boolean operators AND, OR, NOT &#40;alternatively you can write them as &amp;&amp;, &#124;&#124;, &#33;&#41; are supported and can be entered directly into the search box. NOT takes precedence over AND, which takes precendence over OR and you can combine these operators with brackets. These operators can affect the terms to the left and right of them.</p>
            <p>You can also use the prefered Elasticsearch operators &lsquo;&#43;&lsquo; &#40;which means the term MUST be present&#41; and &lsquo;&#45;&rsquo; &#40;which means the term MUST NOT be present&#41;.  These operators can only affect the terms to the right of them.</p>
            <p>The example below finds all results for &quot;shakespeare&quot; without &quot;venice&quot; in.</p>
            <pre>
                shakespeare &#45;venice</pre>
                
		  <p>By default, any terms you enter in the search box MUST be present. For instance, all of the searches below are identical&#58;</p>
            <pre>
           	shakespeare &#45;venice ode</pre>
			<pre>
            	&#43;shakespeare &#45;venice ode</pre>
			<pre>
            	&#43;shakespeare &#45;venice &#43;ode</pre>
                
          <h2>Wildcard operators</h2>
            <p>Two wildcard operators are available&#58;</p>
            <pre>
                &#42; &#61; Match any character, including no character
                &#63; &#61; Match any single character&#59; will not match no character</pre>
            <p>Please avoid wildcard characters occurring at or before the third position as they may produce too many unrelated matches.</p>
            
            
          <h2>Reserved characters</h2>
            <p>Certain characters function as operators in the system and if you want to use them in your search query, but not as an operator, then you will need to escape them with a leading backslash. </p>
            <p>The reserved characters are:</p>
            <pre>
                &#43; &#45; &amp;&amp; &#124;&#124; &#33; &#40; &#41; &#123; &#125; &#91; &#93; &#94; &quot; &#126; &#42; &#63; &#58; &#92; &#47;</pre>

                <p>To view an article simply select a record from your results list or the browse pages by clicking on the thumbnail or title hyperlink for it.

                <p>The Viewer is comprised of three panels&#58; a central panel displaying the images&#59; a Search panel to the left&#59; and a Details panel to the right, which are collapsed by default.
