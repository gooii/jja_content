            <h2 id="q1">Who can access Spare Rib&#63;</h2>

            <p>Spare Rib is open and accessible to all. To accommodate the addition of the Spare Rib journal in 2015, the Search feature of the Journal Archives service has been made open to all. 
            <br />As such, it is possible for anybody to search the complete Journal Archives catalogue &#40;including Spare Rib&#41;, although only the Spare Rib content is open&#45;access for viewing and downloading.
			<br />No authentication is required to access Spare Rib.</p>

            <h2 id="q2">Can I download the issues and articles&#63;</h2>
            <p>All issues and articles on the Spare Rib are available for download in the .PDF format from the Viewer. To download, click the Download icon &#40;it looks like a little downward&#45;facing arrow&#41; once you have the relevant article or issue open in the Viewer, and select &ldquo;Download publication as a PDF&rdquo; from the drop&#45;down menu. 
			<br />You can download <a href="http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/" title="Adobe Reader">Adobe Reader</a> free from the Adobe website to view the downloaded PDF files if you do not have suitable PDF reader software already installed on your computer.</p>

            <h2 id="q3">How can I share an issue or article&#63;</h2>
            <p>Once you&#39;ve opened an issue or article in the Viewer, clicking the Share icon in the Navigation bar &#40;it looks like a little arrow pointing to the right&#41; will display a popup window with a permanent URL that directly links back to the article or issue you&#39;re currently viewing.

	              <h2 id="q4">Why is some of the content blacked out&#63;</h2>
            <p>Some material from the Spare Rib Journal Archives platform has been redacted until the Library is able to secure further copyright permissions. 
			<br />The material relates to the contributions of approximately 1000 people to the magazine, and makes up around 20&#37; of the content.
			<br />The entire run of physical copies of Spare Rib can be consulted in the British Library Reading Rooms and other libraries around the UK.
            <br />Spare Rib remains a very rich digital resource, and <a href="http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/socialscience/2016/04/update-on-the-digital-spare-rib-important-information-for-researchers-and-contributors.html">we will reinstate works where permission is granted in future.</a>
			</p>
			
			            <h2 id="q5">Can I view the full text&#63;</h2>
            <p>Full text is available in the Viewer for all articles &#45; you can access it by opening the right hand Details panel in the Viewer and clicking the Text tab. 
			<br />No full text is available in the Viewer for complete issues, although the PDF files for both articles and issues are searchable using an external PDF viewing program like Adobe Reader.</p>
			
			            <h2 id="q6">Can I search both Spare Rib and the other Journal Archives collections together&#63;</h2>
            <p>Yes &#45; Spare Rib is searchable as a part of the main Journal Archives service, but also has its own landing page to allow you to search it on its own.
