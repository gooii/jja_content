				<h1>Suspension of access to the Spare Rib Jisc archive</h1>
					
				<h4>12 April 2019</h4>
				
				<p ng-style="{'margin-bottom': '20px'}">We regret to inform you that as a result of the UK leaving the EU the full run of the feminist magazine <b>Spare Rib,</b> hosted on the Jisc Journal Archives platform and digitised by the British Library, is no longer available. We know this resource was used by researchers, activists, students and teachers, not only in the UK but around the world and greatly regret having to suspend the resource. It is unclear whether or when it will be possible to make the resource available online again. We are sorry for the disruption and disappointment this may cause. Information about why the Spare Rib online resource has been closed can be found on the <a href="https://blogs.bl.uk/socialscience/2019/02/spare-rib-archive-possible-suspension-of-access.html" title="Link to British Library blog page" target="_self">British Libraryâ€™s website.</a></p>
					
				<p>Though the entire run of Spare Rib magazines is now unavailable online, the curated <a href="https://www.bl.uk/spare-rib" title="Link to British Library SpareRib home page" target="_self">British Library Spare Rib site</a>, with its contextual essays and selected magazine content is still accessible. The full run of hard copy magazines is also available to British Library readers on site at the British Library in St Pancras and Boston Spa.</p>
