				<h4><b>27 Feb 2019&#58; Warning for Users of the Spare Rib Jisc Archive &#45; possible suspension of access.</b></h4>
				
				<p ng-style="{'margin-bottom': '20px'}">We regret to inform you that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal on the 29th March the full run of the feminist magazine <b>Spare Rib,</b> hosted on the Jisc Journal Archives platform and digitised by the British Library, will no longer be available. We know this resource is used by researchers, activists, students and teachers, not only in the UK but around the world and greatly regret the possible need to suspend the resource.  We are sorry for the disruption and disappointment this will cause if it proves necessary. Information about why the Spare Rib online resource may have to be closed down can be found on the <a href="https://blogs.bl.uk/socialscience/2019/02/spare-rib-archive-possible-suspension-of-access.html?_ga=2.20725053.407769585.1551117905-1687223040.1515077818" title="Link to BL website blog" target="_self">British Libraryâ€™s website.</a></p>
				
				<p ng-style="{'margin-bottom': '20px'}">Though the entire run of Spare Rib magazines may be unavailable online from the 29th March, the curated <a href="https://www.bl.uk/spare-rib" title="Link to BL Spare Rib page" target="_self">British Library Spare Rib</a> site, with its contextual essays and selected magazine content will still be accessible. The full run of hard copy magazines will also remain available to British Library readers on site at the British Library in St Pancras and Boston Spa.</p>
				
				<p ng-style="{'margin-bottom': '20px'}">There are currently three possible outcomes for the <b>Spare Rib</b> Jisc archive&#58;</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>In the case of a &#34;no deal&#34; Brexit being confirmed the <b>Spare Rib</b> Jisc online resource will no longer be available from the 29th March 2019. It is unclear whether or when it will be possible to make the resource available online again.</li>
					<li>In the case of a managed transition to leaving the EU the <b>Spare Rib</b> Jisc resource will remain available until December 2020. It is unclear whether or when it will be possible to make the resource available again.</li>
					<li>In the case of Britain remaining in the EU or the UK reaches some form of agreement to align UK copyright with the EU the <b>Spare Rib</b> Jisc archive will remain available.</li>

				<p ng-style="{'margin-bottom': '20px'}"><i>Spare Rib</i> was an active part of the emerging Women&#39;s Liberation Movement in the late 20th century. Running from 1972&#45;93, this now iconic magazine challenged the stereotyping and exploitation of women, while supporting collective, realistic solutions to the hurdles women faced.</p>

					    <p ng-style="{'margin-bottom': '20px'}">Visitors to this site can explore selected highlights from the magazine&#59; and examine how the magazine was run, why it was started and the issues it dealt with. The full run of Spare Rib magazines can be accessed via <a href="/britishlibrary/sparerib">https&#58;&#47;&#47;www.journalarchives.jisc.ac.uk&#47;britishlibrary&#47;sparerib.</a></p>
