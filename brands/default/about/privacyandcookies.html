            <h2>What are cookies and what are they used for&#63;</h2>

<p>Cookies are small text files that are stored by your web browser. 
<br />They are primarily used to remember if users have visited the website before, and to improve the way that sites work. 
<br />We use them for authenticating users and to record anonymised usage information.</p>

More information can be found at <a href="https://AboutCookies.org">aboutcookies.org</a> or <a href="http://AllAboutCookies.org">allaboutcookies.org</a>

           <h2>Authentication</h2>

<p>The Shibboleth cookie for authenticated user sessions is called idp&#95;session. These expire after an hour.</p>
<p>You can read more about Shibboleth session cookies here&#58; <a href="https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/IdPCookieUsage">https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/IdPCookieUsage</a></p>

<h2>Measuring Website Usage</h2>
            
<p>We use Google Analytics to measure usage of the service. 
<br />The cookies generated by Google Analytics are only available to Journal Archives and do not reveal any information that would cause users to be personally identifiable.

            <h2>Surveys</h2>

<p>Periodically we will add a popup survey to the Journal Archives homepage to gather feedback from users. 
<br />This survey is not active for the majority of the year but is usually in effect for the month of November. 
<br />The cookie generated by this survey is called COOKIE_NAME_TBC</p>

<h2>Managing and deleting cookies</h2>

<p>We use cookies to improve the way our website works, and we don&#39;t gather any personally identifiable information. 
<br />Blocking or deleting the cookies will impact on the way that the site works and you could lose some functionality.
