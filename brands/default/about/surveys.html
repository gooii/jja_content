                <p>Seems like a remarkably impressive resource, and very nicely presented.  I am rather surprised I was not previously aware of it.</p>

			<p>The new Journal Archives platform was released on 23 June 2014, replacing the previous Jisc Journal Archives platform. Journal Archives uses different search software to Jisc Journal Archives and includes a new custom-designed interface. If comparisons are made with previous surveys, respondents were referring to the Jisc Journal Archives platform. </p>

			<h3>Summary of feedback</h3>


			<p>We were pleased to find that 66&#37; of respondents selected the top three highest recommendation ratings of 8, 9 and 10, indicating that they would recommend Journal Archives to a colleague. 73&#37; of respondents advised their overall experience of the service over the last 12 months was good and 73&#37; agreed that their work would take longer if Journal Archives was not available.</p>


			<p>We asked respondents to rate various aspects of the website this year and found that 75&#37; rated the quality of the content as good, 87.5&#37; rated the readability of the text on the support pages as good and 79&#37; rated the visual design as good. There were slightly more mixed results for site search (62&#37; rated it as good but 15&#37; rated it as poor) and navigation (60&#37; rated it as good but 21&#37; rated it as poor). </p>
            

			<p>We asked what people liked about the service and respondents commented on the the fact that they could use one interface to view muliple sources of journals.</p>


			<p>We also asked how the service could be improved. A range of suggestions were made including improved search, more content and improved citation downloads.</p>
