            <h3 id="2015-05-28">Press release&#58; Spare Rib enters the digital age&#58; all 239 editions of the landmark feminist magazine published online for the first time</h3>
            <h4>28 May 2015</h4>

            <p>Few titles sum up an era and a movement like Spare Rib. With its commitment to challenging the status quo, Spare Rib battled oppression and gave a voice to the struggles, discussions and debates of diverse groups of women over the 21 years it was in print &#40;1972&#45;1993&#41;.</p>
            <p>From today, every edition of Spare Rib magazine will be available to be viewed by anyone online for free.</p>
            <p>The <a href="http://bl.uk/spare-rib" title="British Library Spare Rib website">British Library will host a curated Spare Rib website</a> featuring 300 selected pages from the magazine, alongside articles written by academics, activists and former contributors about how Spare Rib was run, its history and the issues it tackled.</p>
            <p>This site will link through to the website for <a href="http://jisc.ac.uk" title="Jisc website">Jisc</a>, a charity which supports digital technologies in UK education and research, where the entire run of magazines will be available to view. Jisc&#39;s Journal Archives platform allows users to browse across 239 issues and locate material from more than 11,000 pages of the magazine.</p>
            <p>Until now, the full run of magazines has only been available for consultation in the British Library reading rooms and a few other libraries and archives.</p>
            <p>The digitised Spare Rib site will mean that researchers, historians, students and anyone interested in feminism or activism can search across all 239 editions for the first time, transforming the way in which the magazines can be accessed, discovered and re&#45;used.</p>
            <p><strong>Polly Russell, Curator of Politics and Public Life at the British Library commented&#58;</strong></p>
            <p>&ldquo;Funny, irreverent, intelligent and passionate, Spare Rib was a product of its time which is also somehow timeless.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Detailed features on feminist issues such as domestic violence and abortion, and news stories about women from the UK and around the world sit side&#45;by&#45;side with articles about hair care &#40;including the unwanted kind&#41;, how to put up a shelf and instructions on self&#45;defence.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Just as varied were the breadth of voices in the magazine&#59; early editions of Spare Rib involved big&#45;name contributors including Betty Friedan, Germaine Greer, Margaret Drabble and Alice Walker, but alongside these were the voices of ordinary women telling their own stories.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;By making this part of our intellectual heritage available online, we hope it will attract new and returning generations of readers to the magazines for research, inspiration and enjoyment.&rdquo;</p>

A detailed article based on accounts by ordinary women about what sexual liberation means in the bedroom. Typical of Spare Rib&#39;s bold and honest style, articles like this one broke long&#45;held silences on the female sexual experience for many women</li>

Now called female genital mutilation, Spare Rib was at the forefront of a campaign to get the practice of &lsquo;cliterectomy&rsquo; stopped. Written by multiple authors, this forward&#45;thinking article includes detailed analysis of the subject in the context of overall attitudes to sexuality, progeny and power

            <p>This project has been developed in consultation with the original community who founded and published Spare Rib. </p>
            <p><strong>Marsha Rowe, co&#45;founder of Spare Rib magazine, said&#58;</strong></p>
            <p>&ldquo;I&#39;m thrilled at the digitization of Spare Rib by the British Library. It&#39;s as if the magazine has been given a new lease of life. By making the magazine freely available over the internet, it can encourage women round the world to act together for change and be a resource in support of their struggle for rights and freedoms.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><strong>Sue O&#39;Sullivan, who worked full time at Spare Rib from 1979&#45;1984, said&#58;</strong> </p>
            <p>&ldquo;Spare Rib was a highly visible part of the Women&#39;s Liberation Movement, and a tool for reaching thousands of women every single month for over 20 years. The digitised magazines will be a wonderful resource for younger historians and feminist activists, researchers and all the women &#40;and men&#41; who wonder what their mothers, aunts, grannies and older friends got up to all those years ago.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><strong>Debra Ferreday, Senior Lecturer, Centre for Gender and Women&#39;s Studies, Lancaster University comments&#58;</strong></p>
            <p>&ldquo;The importance of the Spare Rib archive can&#39;t be overestimated. It&#39;s a unique record of the Women&#39;s Liberation Movement which will be of huge value to feminist researchers, scholars, students and activists everywhere. I&#39;m delighted that Jisc and the British Library have made this material available in such an accessible, user&#45;friendly form.&rdquo;</p>

            <h3 id=“2013-10-15”>Support pages for librarians</h3>
            <h4>15 Oct 2013</h4>

            <p>We have created support pages for librarians for Jisc Historic Books and Jisc Journal Archives:</p>

            <p>Jisc Historic Books: <a href="http://ecollections.mimas.ac.uk/books/librarians.html">http://ecollections.mimas.ac.uk/books/librarians.html</a> </p>
            <p>Jisc Journal Archives: <a href="http://ecollections.mimas.ac.uk/journals/librarians.html">http://ecollections.mimas.ac.uk/journals/librarians.html</a> </p>


            <p>These pages contain information to help librarians manage and monitor access to the platforms, for example authentication options, WAYFless URLs and usage statistics. For Jisc Journal Archives the page also contains KBART format holdings lists.</p>
            <p>These pages also provide details of our scheduled maintenance periods. In order to keep the platforms running at optimal performance we need to undertake maintenance tasks from time to time. We aim to schedule this on Tuesdays between 07:00-09:00, where possible, to minimise the impact on people using the system. When specific maintenance has been scheduled we will notify you of the date.</p>
            <p>For Jisc Historic Books we have scheduled the following dates for maintenance work which may require us to restart the system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tuesday 29 October 2013</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Tuesday 26 November 2013</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>In these instances the platform may be unavailable for around 15 minutes at some point between 07:00 and 09:00 and should be considered *at risk*.</p>
            <p>We hope you find these pages helpful, and if there are any questions about them, or additional content that you would like to see included, please do contact our helpdesks at <a href="mailto:historicbooks@mimas.ac.uk">historicbooks@mimas.ac.uk</a> or <a href="mailto:journalarchives@mimas.ac.uk">journalarchives@mimas.ac.uk</a>.</p>

            <p>We were pleased to see that 76&#37; of respondents found JISC Journal Archives easy to use, 90&#37; agreed that their work would take longer without it and 95&#37; of respondents would recommend JISC Journal Archives. Features that were liked include the ability to search a variety of journals in one place and being able to download them all as PDFs. Suggested improvements included adding more material and showing the article abstracts.</p>
            <p>The full <a href="../files/JJA_survey_report_2012-13.pdf"> user satisfaction survey report</a> &#40;PDF&#41; is available now and some highlights are shown below.</p>

            <p>A selection of comments we received&#58;</p>
            <p><em>Higher Education, undergraduate student&#58; </em></p>
            <p><strong>	&ldquo;Jisc would be highly beneficial to any student&rdquo;</strong></p>
            <p><em>Higher Education, undergraduate student&#58; </em></p>
            <p><strong>&ldquo;Everything I want&#47;need is easy to find. All the information is given on the cover &lsquo;sheets&rsquo; from which the articles can be downloaded, and so referencing is made that much easier&rdquo;</strong></p>
            <p><em>Higher Education, undergraduate student&#58; </em></p>
            <p><strong>&ldquo;Because it is the main journal archive that I use &#45; I find it the most reliable and most likely to have the sources I require&rdquo;</strong></p>

            <p>We really appreciate people taking the time to provide this valuable feedback and all comments and responses have been reviewed by the team and will be taken on board as we develop the platform.</p>

            <h3 id=”2013-04-30”>New content available in Jisc Journal Archives</h3>
            <h4>30 Apr 2013</h4>


            <p>We are pleased to announce that new titles are now available in our Oxford Journals Archive and our Cambridge Journals Digital Archive.</p>

            <p><strong>Oxford Journals Archive Upgrade</strong></p>
            <p>The Oxford Journals Archive Upgrade is now available in Jisc Journal Archives. The upgrade includes an additional 32 Oxford University Press &#40;OUP&#41; journals containing over 76,000 articles that have been digitised since the original archive was purchased by Jisc Collections in 2006. Each journal is available from volume one issue one until the last issue in 1995. </p>
            <p>We have also received and indexed data previously missing from the Medicine Archive &#40;1878&#45;1995&#41; and the Science Archive &#40;1878&#45;1995&#41; from the original Oxford Journals Archive data provided to us.</p>

            <p>All the new Oxford Journals Archive titles available in Jisc Journal Archives are listed in <a href="../files/jja_oup_new_30.04.13.pdf">PDF</a> and <a href="../files/jiscjournalarchives_oup_new_30.04.13.xlsx">KBART file</a> formats. </p>

            <p>To view all the titles now included in the Oxford Journals Archive please see the platform <a href="http://www.jiscjournalarchives.ac.uk/browse/oup/">browse</a> page.</p>

            <p>Additionally we have made some improvements to the way the OUP Notes and Queries articles have been indexed. Previously the titles were not very indicative of the contents, for example&#58; &ldquo;Notes and Queries&#58; s1&#45;I.1.10&rdquo; as shown in the screenshot below.</p>
            <p><img src="../images/support/screenshots/oup-notes-old.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Oxford Unoversity Press Notes and Queries content in Jisc Journal Archives - old view" /></p>
            <p>We have now created titles that are a concatenated list of the titles included on each page. The title for the example above is now &ldquo;LIBER SENTENTIARUM.&#45;INQUISITION OF THOULOUSE&#59; NEW FACTS ABOUT LADY ARABELLA STUART&rdquo;, which is comprised of the following titles in the article&#58;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>LIBER SENTENTIARUM. &#45; INQUISITION OF THOULOUSE.</li>
                <li>NEW FACTS ABOUT LADY ARABELLA STUART.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This means the titles are more descriptive when they appear in your search results and when navigating the browse pages&#58;</p>
            <p><img src="../images/support/screenshots/oup-notes-new.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Oxford Unoversity Press Notes and Queries content in Jisc Journal Archives - new view" /></p>

            <p><strong>Cambridge Journals Digital Archive</strong></p>
            <p>We have also now received, loaded and indexed the Humanities and Social Sciences titles from the Cambridge Journals Digital Archive. Previously only titles from the Scientific, Technical and Medical collection were available in Jisc Journal Archives. </p>

            <p>All the new Cambridge Journals Digital Archive titles available in Jisc Journal Archives are listed in <a href="../files/jja_cup_new_30.04.13.pdf">PDF</a> and <a href="../files/jiscjournalarchives_cup_new_30.04.13.xlsx">KBART file</a> formats. </p>

            <p>To view all the titles now included in the Cambridge Journals Digitial Archive please see the platform <a href="http://www.jiscjournalarchives.ac.uk/browse/cup/">browse</a> page.</p>

            <p>A full list of all the titles available in Jisc Journal Archives can be found in our KBART file&#58; <a href="files/jiscjournalarchives_AllTitles_2013-04-28.xlsx">MS Excel version</a> &#40;140 kB&#41;, <a href="../files/jiscjournalarchives_AllTitles_2013-04-28.txt">text version</a> &#40;144 kB&#41;. </p>
            <p>The list follows the <a href="http://www.uksg.org/kbart/s1/summary">Knowledge Bases And Related Tools &#40;KBART&#41;</a> format, so you will notice that there are repeated lines for journal titles where the sequence of titles is broken by one or more years. There are some journals where there are multiple breaks of one year, even though the sequence of volumes is unbroken, so they also appear on multiple lines.</p>

            <h3 id=“2012-03-07”>Taylor &#38; Francis Geography, Planning, Urban and Environment Online Archive now available.</h3>
            <h4>07 Mar 2012</h4>

            <p>The Taylor &#38; Francis Geography, Planning, Urban and Environment Online Archive is now available in JISC Journal Archives.</p>

            <p>The archive contains the backfiles of 28 journals published under the Routledge imprint between 1884 and 1996. Many of the titles included are published on behalf of other societies and organisations, for example Landscape Research &#40;The Landscape Research Group&#41; and European Planning Studies &#40;The Association of European Schools of Planning &#40;AESOP&#41;. The archive includes many well established journals, influential in their field, for example Australian Geographer and the Scottish Geographical Journal &#40;previously titled Scottish Geographical Magazine&#41;.</p>

            <p>As some journals have had title changes during the period covered by JISC Journal Archives, you will notice they will be listed under both titles, along with the relevant volumes and issues for each one.</p>

            <p>For example, the Journal of Property Research was known as Land Development Studies between 1984 &#45; 1990. JISC Journal Archives coverage for this title is 1984 &#45; 1996 so you will find it listed as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Journal of Property Research: 1991 &#45; 1996 </li>
                <li>Land Development Studies: 1984 &#45; 1990 </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Details of all the title changes for this archive can be found on our new <a href="http://ecollections.mimas.ac.uk/journals/changes.html">Title Changes</a> page.</p>

            <p>You can browse the journals, and access the full text for each article, from the <a href="http://www.jiscjournalarchives.ac.uk/browse/tf/">JISC Journal Archives browse page</a>.</p>

            <h4>15 June 2011</h4>


            <p>As part of the development process for JISC Historic Books and JISC Journal Archives, we are currently setting up UK Access Management Federation access &#40;Shibboleth and OpenAthens&#41;, and IP authentication where institutions do not have Shibboleth or OpenAthens.</p>
            <p>While we are setting this up, when you go to the platform urls you will find a username and password prompt. This is only temporary and UK Access Management Federation access will be setup shortly. If, in the meantime, you would like to access these platforms please contact the helpdesk at: <a href="mailto:journalarchives@mimas.ac.uk">journalarchives@mimas.ac.uk</a> to request a temporary username and password.</p>
            <p>We do apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
