            <h2 id="about">About the <i>Spare Rib</i> Digitisation Project </h2>

			
            <p>The <i>Spare Rib</i> digitisation project was instigated and funded by the British Library in June 2013 and launched in May 2015.</p>

            <p>The project is made up of two web resources, the British Library&#39;s curated <i>Spare Rib</i> website which features over 20 contextual articles and 300 examples of content selected from the magazine for anyone interested in discovering more about this history of this iconic magazine, and the full run of searchable <i>Spare Rib</i> magazine content available for free via the Journal Archives platform <a href="https://journalarchives.jisc.ac.uk/britishlibrary/sparerib">here.</a></p>

            <p>Special thanks to our Advisory Board, Marsha Rowe, Sue O&#39;Sullivan, Rose Ades and Ruthie Petrie and to volunteer and part&#45;time project worker Louise Kimpton&#45;Nye.</p>

		

		
            <h2 id="researchers">Important information for researchers</h2>

			
			<p>From 1<sup>st</sup> June 2016, some material from the <i>Spare Rib</i> <a href="https://journalarchives.jisc.ac.uk/britishlibrary/sparerib">Journal Archives platform</a> will be redacted until the Library is able to secure further copyright permissions.</p>

            <p>This material relates to the contributions of approximately 1000 people to the magazine, and makes up around 20&#37;	of the content.</p>
			
			<p>The entire run of physical copies of <i>Spare Rib</i> can be consulted in the British Library Reading Rooms and other libraries around the UK.</p>
			
			<p><i>Spare Rib</i> remains a very rich digital resource, and we will seek to reinstate works where permission is granted in future.</p>

			<h2 id="contributors">Seeking contributors</h2>

			
            <p>The British Library would like to offer researchers the most complete version of the digital <i>Spare Rib</i> website possible, and is working with various trade bodies representing authors, photographers and visual artists to continue to seek contributors to the magazine, and wherever possible reinstate material which has been removed because its copyright status is difficult to resolve.</p>
			
			<p>We appeal for anyone who has written, photographed or created any content for <i>Spare Rib</i> magazine who has not been in contact with us yet to come forward and confirm whether they give permission for their work to be made available on the site.</p>

			<p>Additionally, if you have received correspondence from the British Library about this project and you are not a <i>Spare Rib</i> contributor, please let us know so we can remove you from our records.</p>
			
			<p>If any <i>Spare Rib</i> contributor or a third party objects to the inclusion of their work now or at any point in the future, or wishes to make their content live but with restrictions, we can anonymise, make alterations or remove the material. In this event, please contact&#58; <a href="mailto:noticeandtakedown@bl.uk">noticeandtakedown&#64;bl.uk.</a></p>
            
			<p>The British Library is very grateful to the many contributors who have given permission for their material to be made available for this project.</p>
