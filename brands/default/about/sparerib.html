            <h2 id="about">About the <i>Spare Rib</i> Digitisation Project </h2>

			
			
            <p><i>Spare Rib</i> was the largest feminist circulating magazine of the Women&#39;s Liberation Movement &#40;WLM&#41; in Britain of the 1970s and 80s. It remains one of the movement&#39;s most visible achievements. The trajectory of <i>Spare Rib</i> charted the rise and demise of the Women&#39;s Liberation Movement and as a consequence is of interest to feminist historians, academics and activists and to those studying social movements and media history.</p>

            <p>The <i>Spare Rib</i> digitisation project makes available the entire run of fully searchable <i>Spare Rib</i> magazines via a digital journals archive platform hosted by Jisc alongside this curated British Library website. The British Library&#39;s website features over 20 contextual articles and 300 examples of content selected from the magazine.</p>

            <p>The magazine&#39;s content is eclectic and varied and as such represents the many facets of the Women&#39;s Liberation Movement and women&#39;s experiences. Contributors ranged from well&#45;known feminist writers, activists and theorists from around the world as well as the voices of ordinary women telling their own stories.</p>

            <p>The <i>Spare Rib</i> Digitisation project was instigated and funded by the British Library in June 2013 with the aim to preserve, digitise and make freely available online the complete run of <i>Spare Rib</i> magazines &#40;239 editions altogether between 1972&#45;1993&#41;.</p>

			
			
            <h2 id="challenge">The challenges of digitising <i>Spare Rib</i></h2>
			
			
			<p>Unlike most magazines, <i>Spare Rib</i> operated as a collective.  The magazine&#39;s collective shared all editorial and production decisions about the magazine and all the 4600 or so contributors probably retained copyright over their content, though for certain periods even this is not entirely clear. Over the two decades of its existence the membership of the collective regularly changed.</p>

            <p>Under the copyright laws in 2013 when we started this project, all circa 4600 contributors to the magazine would have to be found in order to seek permission to publish their works.</p>
			
			<p>Owing to the large number of copyright holders &#40;contributors&#41; it was clear that rights clearance, not digitising the magazine would be the biggest hurdle.</p>

			
            <h2 id="pilot">The pilot project</h2>

			
			
            <p>In October 2013, we met with former collective members to kick off a pilot project to see whether we could digitise the complete run of <i>Spare Rib</i> &#40;1972&#45;1993&#41;. We made direct contact with 20 former collective members, including the founding co&#45;editors. All collective members we have located were fully supportive of the digitisation project.</p>
			
			<p>We created a small working party comprised of former <i>Spare Rib</i> Collective members who have been instrumental in advising and shaping the direction of the project as well as locating former <i>Spare Rib</i> contributors.  This group includes founder member Marsha Rowe, Sue O&#39;Sullivan, Ruthie Petrie and Rose Ades.</p>

			<p>To start the process, we audited all 239 magazine issues and identified that there are over 4558 copyright holders. We defined all writers, illustrators, designers and photographers as copyright holders.</p>
			
			
            <h2 id="rights">Rights Clearance Process</h2>

			
            <p>Over the next 6&#45;8 months we recruited a team of 15 volunteers &#40;many ex&#45;contributors&#41; to reach out to as many contributors as possible, using a professional rights clearance agency, feminist networks, professional bodies, and the address books of the collective members themselves.</p>
			
			<p>From those contributors we did manage to contact, we had a resoundingly positive response, but we soon realised the scale of the task would be overwhelming.</p>
			
			<p>The men and women who worked on the magazine were scattered all over the globe, many had changed names or worked under professional names which are now hard to track.</p>
			
			
			
			<h2 id="forward">After the pilot, how we moved forward</h2>
			
		    <p>Over the next 6&#45;8 months we recruited a team of 15 volunteers &#40;many ex&#45;contributors&#41; to identify copyright holders and elicited the help of those collective members and contributors we were in touch with to reach out to as many other contributors as possible.  We used a professional rights clearance agency, feminist networks, professional bodies, and the address books of the collective members themselves to help with our searches for former contributors. From those contributors we did manage to contact, we had a resoundingly positive response, but we soon realised the scale of the task would be overwhelming. The men and women who worked on the magazine were scattered all over the globe, many had changed names or worked under professional names which are now hard to track.</p>
			
            <p>We are very grateful to the many hundreds of contributors who gave permission for their material to be made available on the web site. The library is still seeking contributors, working with the kind help of various trade bodies in this process.  Initially the library asked for permission to publish under a CC BY NC licence, but having listened to feedback about the resource, we are additionally offering contributors the option of providing their content under terms and conditions which limit use of the contributions to private study and non&#45;commercial research and educational purposes only.</p>
			
            <p>Last October new legislation &#45; <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2861/contents/made">the Certain Permitted Uses of Orphan Works Regulations</a> &#45; became law which allows certain institutions, including libraries, to digitise and make available online in&#45;copyright works classed as orphan, where you are unable to conclusively identify or locate an individual upon completion of a diligent search.</p>
			
            <p>Any content which falls in this category may only be used in accordance with copyright law, such as &#40;in the UK&#41; fair dealing for private study or research for a non&#45;commercial purpose.</p>
			
            <p>For these contributions a statement will be displayed next to the item, e.g.&#58; <i>We have been unable to locate the copyright holder for this item. Please contact <a href="mailto:copyright@bl.uk">copyright@bl.uk</a> with any information you have regarding this item.</i>
			
            <p>Whilst we want the resource to be a faithful reproduction of the original, we are conscious that over time people may change their views.  The web brings a higher level of visibility compared to when <i>Spare Rib</i> was published and some people may not want their content being made readily available. In the event that any <i>Spare Rib</i> contributor or a third party objects to the inclusion of their work now or at any point in the future, we can anonymise, make alterations or remove the material. In this event please contact&#58;

            <p>We are enormously grateful to all the former contributors, collective members, volunteers, our hosting agent Jisc and the professional organisations such as ALCS, BAPLA and DACS for their ongoing practical support which has made this project happen.</p>
			
            <p><a href="https://journalarchives.jisc.ac.uk/britishlibrary/sparerib">The digitised full run of <i>Spare Rib</i> magazines</a> will be a valued and important resource now and for generations to come. Special thanks to our Advisory Board, Marsha Rowe, Sue O&#39;Sullivan, Rose Ades and Ruthie Petrie and to volunteer and part&#45;time project worker Louise Kimton&#45;Nye. This project has been generously funded by the British Library.</p>
			
            <p>We still want to hear from former contributors, and are still looking for rightsholders, so if you are a <i>Spare Rib</i> contributor, or you know someone who was, then please ask them to get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:copyright@bl.uk">copyright@bl.uk</a></p>
